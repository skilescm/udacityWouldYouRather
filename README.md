# Would You Rather?

This project was built as a project for a react nanodegree on Udacity. The purpose of this project is to allow a user to select between two options. Stating "what they would rather".

## How does it work?
This was built using a prebuilt API provided by Udacity. A user has the option to login if they already have an account, or register for initial use. Once the user has been authneticated, a list of questions is displayed for them to select and answer to. There is also an option for the user to create a question of their own to be added to the question set. A leaderboard is also present to show the user their ranking compared to other users based on question submissions and questions answered.


## Running the application

This process is pretty straightforward. You just have to run the following commands to get in order.

```
git clone https://github.com/BrainBuzzer/would_you_rather
cd would_you_rather
npm install                     # Or yarn install
npm start                       # Or yarn start
```

And you will have the application up and running.
