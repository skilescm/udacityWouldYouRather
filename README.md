# Would You Rather?

This project has been built as a part of react nanodegree present on Udacity. This project utilises default data provided by Udacity Starter code. This code can be found in `src/utils/_DATA.js` file. All of the API is created with the help of this source file.

## Purpose

This application is built to demonstrate my skills in React, Redux, and designing. I have a seperate section and repository dedicated to design process. All in all, two of the most important skills of mine are represented here.

1. React
2. Redux

## Design

With this project, I decided that it will have design that I want rather than using the old frameworks like Bootstrap, Semantic UI, or Foundation. Just to reset the browser defaults, I am using normalize.css. Adobe recently made Adobe XD free. So I took it for a little spin, and made a little design for this project.

I did not use any CSS PreProcessor for this project. Although CSS does not follow in design conventions, JavaScript for this project follows standard ESLint design pattern.

You may find the design file at https://github.com/BrainBuzzer/design.

## Approach

I have taken a top-down approach with this project, meaning that I have started by developing the largest parts of UI first, and then keep breaking them down to smaller components.

## Running the application

This process is pretty straightforward. You just have to run the following commands to get in order.

```
git clone https://github.com/BrainBuzzer/would_you_rather
cd would_you_rather
npm install                     # Or yarn install
npm start                       # Or yarn start
```

And you will have the application up and running.
